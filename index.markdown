title: Welcome to my research Web Page

PhD student in Computer Science at [CIFASIS](http://www.cifasis-conicet.gov.ar). Advised by
[Mauro Jaskelioff](http://www.fceia.unr.edu.ar/~mauro/). My research focuses on
parallelism in a lazy functional environment. I explore parallel models
to develop a new way to measure how parallel programs behave. I think we can use
those models to design automatic tools to improve the speed of parallel
programs. My goal is to make 
an extension to GHC, and a contribution to the scientific community.

Before coming to CIFASIS, I was a student in the department of Computer
Science at [Universidad Nacional de Rosario](http://web.fceia.unr.edu.ar/) from
where I graduated in March, 2015.  In 2013, I worked as intern at
[IMDEA](https://software.imdea.org/) (Madrid, Spain) under the tutelage of
[Benedikt Schmidt](http://beschmi.net/), in the development of automatic
tactics in [EasyCrypt](https://www.easycrypt.info/trac/).

My interests include: theoretical computer science, programming languages
theory, type theory, category theory, mathematics, and logic.

I am part of project [QuickFuzz](http://quickfuzz.org/) and I like solving problems
in [ProjectEuler](https://projecteuler.net/) (thinking [problem 51](https://projecteuler.net/problem=51)).
In my recreative moments, I like to play football, grab some beers with
some friends in Antares (a local pub) and read, read and read some more!
