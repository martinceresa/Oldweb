PhD student in Computer Science at [CIFASIS](http://www.cifasis-conicet.gov.ar). Advised by
[Mauro Jaskelioff](http://www.fceia.unr.edu.ar/~mauro/). My research focuses on
Improvement Theory in a Lazy Functional Environment. Improvement Theory has been 
developed extensively by [Prof.
Sands](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~dave/Homepage_David_Sands/Home.html) early in the nineties.
It is based on the notion of *Improvement* presented as a refinement of *Equality* of programs.
So starting from *a* notion of equality my idea is to derive *a* notion of
improvement. Having defined such a notion, there is an entire *theory* to
develop and that is my goal right now. In particular, my efforts are in present
an Improvement Theory with effectful computations.

Before coming to CIFASIS, I was a student in the department of Computer
Science at [Universidad Nacional de Rosario](http://web.fceia.unr.edu.ar/) from
where I graduated in March, 2015.

In 2013, I worked as intern at [IMDEA](https://software.imdea.org/) (Madrid,
Spain) under the tutelage of [Benedikt Schmidt](http://beschmi.net/), in the
development of automatic tactics in
[EasyCrypt](https://www.easycrypt.info/trac/). In this internship I have learned
about Modern Cryptography Proofs, and a bit about tactic development. I
developed an automatic tactic (or *megatactic*) which implemented a *classic*
cryptography step called *optimistic sampling*.

My interests include: theoretical computer science, programming languages
theory, type theory, category theory, mathematics, foundation of mathematics, topology
and logic. Recently I have found my self studying history of mathematics and philosophy of mathematics.

I like to solve problems in [ProjectEuler](https://projecteuler.net/).

But right now I am more focused on Haskell/Agda problems on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/tinchos).

In my free time moments, I like to meditate (mindfulness), do some Yoga
(Hatha/Dynamic) or even better practice Capoeira! I love to hangout with my
friends and enjoy myself reading to death.
