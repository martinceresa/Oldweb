My PhD Thesis is based on the study of intentional analysis between programs.
More concretely given a notion of equivalence between programs,
one can refine such notion to perform certain analysis between two given
programs.

Currently I am working in the study of effectful intentional analysis, how we
can reason about programs cost in the presence of computational effects.

My interest includes: functional programming languages, compiler theory, denotational
semantics, generic programming, static analysis and type theory.
I like Category Theory, Topology, Mathematical Logic,
and Haskell.
